# Introduction

- I love wandering around the Internet, listening to music, photo/lomography, tinkering tech stuffs, anime, manga, Japanese culture, etc.
- My mother tongue is Vietnamese, but I can also use English. Currently, I'm learning Japanese too :D

# Traits/Thoughts
Not sorted.
- I'm not addicted to video games anymore, but before, I played lots of different games. I have played video games since first time I used a computer (3yo). The first game I played was Counter Strike, it's still one of my favorite games.
- I listen to multiple genres of music, but mostly Electronic, J-Pop and J-Rock. My favorite artists are TUYU, Ado, YOASOBI, Skrillex, Fred Again.., Porter Robinson, Nujabes, AZALI, Kobaryo, ak+q, Dustvoxx, re:plus, ...
- I don't use *mainstream* social media because I'm concerned about privacy, and the knowledge I learned from social media is very small. Someone once called me an ape for not using social media, lol.
- In real life, my persona is quite different from how I appear online.
- I use **Fedora** and **Arch Linux** as my main operating system. I only use Windows (LTSC, debloated and hardened) when needed.
- I stick to FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and privacy-friendly/self-hosted tools whenever possible.
- I'm not really a fan of **AI**.
- My favorite color is red.
- I have **deuteranopia (red-green colorblindness)** and **ADHD**, which is really annoying in daily life.
