# Introduction
- Hi! My name is **stdrice**
- I'm a high school student, technically a tech (or newborn) paranoid/digital minimalist, otaku(?).
- I love wandering around the Internet, listening to music, photo/lomography, tinkering tech stuffs, anime, manga, Japanese culture, etc.
- My mother tongue is Vietnamese, but I can also use English. I'm learning Japanese too :D
- I'm not addicted to video games anymore, but before, I played lots of different games. I have played video games since first time I used a computer (3yo). The first game I played was Counter Strike, it's still one of my favorite games.
- I listen to multiple genres of music, but mostly Electronic, J-Pop and J-Rock.
- I don't use social media because I'm concerned about privacy, and the knowledge I learned from social media is very small. Someone once told me I was an ape for not using social media.
